# datastore-exporter

Go CLI tool to export Google Cloud Datastore. Exports all kinds and namespaces and saves to a GCS bucket. As the Datastore export operation is asynchronous the process will poll the state of the operation reporting any errors.

To run locally a service account is required with the correct permissions to export from Datastore: 
1. Create a service account with the roles of Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin
2. Download the key as JSON to your local machine
3. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the account key e.g. `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/sa.json

Alternatively if you're using the Helm Chart you can make use of [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) and set the `gcloud.serviceAccount.workloadIdentity` field to your service account's name instead of having to create and manage a secret.

- `$HOME/.config/datastore-exporter.toml`

Alternatively a config file path can be provided through the
-c/--config CLI flag.

#### Example datastore-exporter.toml
```toml
timeout = "1h" # duration the process will run for (default is 1 hour)

[log]
console = true
level = "debug"  # [debug|info|error]

[gcs]
projectID = "project-id" # ID of the Google Cloud Project
bucketName = "bucket-name" # name of the bucket for exports to be saved in
```
